## How to be successful in this course
Taking an online course can be overwhelming. How do you learn at your own pace and successfully achieve your goals? 

Here are some general tips that can help you stay focused and on track.

### Set daily goals for studying 
Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish in your course each day. Setting a clear goal can help you stay motivated and beat procrastination. The goal should be specific and easy to measure, such as "I’ll watch all the videos in Module 2 and complete the first programming assignment". And don’t forget to reward yourself when you make progress towards your goal! 

### Create a dedicated study space 
It’s easier to recall information if you’re in the same place where you first learned it, so having a dedicated space at home to take online courses can make your learning more effective. Remove any distractions from the space and if possible, make it separate from your bed or sofa. A clear distinction between where you study and where you take breaks can help you focus.  

### Schedule time to study on your calendar 
Open your calendar and choose a predictable, reliable time that you can dedicate to watching lectures and completing assignments. This helps ensure that your courses won’t become the last thing on your to-do list. 

_Tip: You can add deadlines for a Coursera course to your Google calendar, Apple calendar, or another calendar app._

### Keep yourself accountable 

Tell your friends about the courses you’re taking, post achievements to your social media accounts or blog about your homework assignments. Having a community and support network of friends and family to cheer you on makes a difference!

### Actively take notes 
Taking notes can promote active thinking, boost comprehension and extend your attention span. It’s a good strategy to internalize knowledge whether you’re learning online or in the classroom. So, grab a notebook or find a digital app that works best for you and start synthesizing key points. 

_Tip: While watching a lecture on Coursera, you can click the 'Save Note' button below the video to save a screenshot to your course notes and add your own comments._

### Join the discussion 
Course discussion forums are a great place to ask questions about assignments, discuss topics, share resources and make friends. Our research shows that learners who participate in the discussion forums are 37% more likely to complete a course. So make a post today! 

### Do one thing at a time 
Multitasking is less productive than focusing on a single task at a time. Researchers from Stanford University found that “People who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.” Stay focused on one thing at a time. You’ll absorb more information and complete assignments with greater productivity and ease than if you were trying to do many things at once.  

### Take breaks 
Resting your brain after learning is critical to high performance. If you find yourself working on a challenging problem without much progress for an hour, take a break. Walking outside, taking a shower or talking with a friend can help you to re-energize and even give you new ideas on how to tackle the project. 

## Your learning journey starts now!  
While preparing for the module quiz or working on achieving your learning goals you're encouraged to:   

* Work through each lesson in the learning pathway. Try not to skip any activities or lessons unless you are certain that you already know this information well enough to move ahead.    

* Take the opportunity to go back and watch a video or read all the information provided before moving on to the next lesson or module.  

* Complete all the knowledge and module quizzes and exercises.

* Read the feedback carefully when answering quizzes, as this will help you to reinforce what you are learning.  

* Make use of the practical learning environment provided by the exercises. You can gain substantial reinforcement of your learning through the step-by-step application of your skills.

## HTTP examples

This reading explores the contents of HTTP requests and responses in more depth.

### Request Line
Every HTTP request begins with the request line.

This consists of the HTTP method, the requested resource and the HTTP protocol version.
```http
GET /home.html HTTP/1.1 
```
In this example, GET is the HTTP method, /home.html is the resource requested and HTTP 1.1 is the protocol used.

### HTTP Methods
HTTP methods indicate the action that the client wishes to perform on the web server resource.

Common HTTP methods are:

| Método HTTP | Descrição |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **GET** | O cliente solicita um recurso no servidor web.          |
| **POST** | O cliente submete dados a um recurso no servidor web.   |
| **PUT** | O cliente substitui (cria ou atualiza completamente) um recurso no servidor web. |
| **DELETE** | O cliente apaga um recurso no servidor web.            |
| **PATCH** | O cliente atualiza *parcialmente* um recurso no servidor web. |


### HTTP Request Headers
After the request line, the HTTP headers are followed by a line break.

There are various possibilities when including an HTTP header in the HTTP request. A header is a case-insensitive name followed by a: and then followed by a value.

Common headers are:

```http
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
Content-type: text/json
```

* The ```Host``` header specifies the host of the server and indicates where the resource is requested from.

* The ```User-Agent``` header informs the web server of the application that is making the request. It often includes the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), version and application vendor.

* The ```Accept``` header informs the web server what type of content the client will accept as the response.

* The ```Accept-Language``` header indicates the language and optionally the locale that the client prefers.

* The ```Content-type``` header indicates the type of content being transmitted in the request body.

### HTTP Request Body
HTTP requests can optionally include a request body. A request body is often included when using the HTTP POST and PUT methods to transmit data.

```json
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

{
 "key1":"value1",
 "key2":"value2",
 "array1":["value3","value4"]
}
```

```json
PUT /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: text/json

{"key1":"value1"}
```

### HTTP Responses
When the web server is finished processing the HTTP request, it will send back an HTTP response.

The first line of the response is the status line. This line shows the client if the request was successful or if an error occurred.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
```

The line begins with the HTTP protocol version, followed by the status code and a reason phrase. The reason phrase is a textual representation of the status code.

### HTTP Status Codes
The first digit of an HTTP status code indicates the category of the response: Information, Successful, Redirection, Client Error or Server Error.

The common status codes you'll encounter for each category are:

#### 1. Códigos 1XX - Informativos

| Status Code | Reason Phrase | Descrição |
|:-----------:|:-------------|:----------|
| **100** | Continue | O servidor recebeu os cabeçalhos da solicitação e o cliente deve continuar a enviar o corpo da solicitação. |
| **101** | Switching Protocols | O cliente solicitou ao servidor que mude os protocolos e o servidor concordou em fazê-lo. |

---

#### 2. Códigos 2XX - Sucesso

| Status Code | Reason Phrase | Descrição |
|:-----------:|:-------------|:----------|
| **200** | OK | Resposta padrão retornada pelo servidor para indicar que ele processou a solicitação com sucesso. |
| **201** | Created | O servidor processou a solicitação com sucesso e um **novo recurso foi criado**. |
| **202** | Accepted | O servidor aceitou a solicitação para processamento, mas o processamento **ainda não foi concluído**. |
| **204** | No Content | O servidor processou a solicitação com sucesso, mas **não está retornando nenhum conteúdo** (por exemplo, após um `DELETE`). |

---

#### 3. Códigos 3XX - Redirecionamento

| Status Code | Reason Phrase | Descrição |
|:-----------:|:-------------|:----------|
| **301** | Moved Permanently | Esta solicitação e todas as solicitações futuras **devem** ser enviadas para o novo local retornado (URL). |
| **302** | Found | Esta solicitação **deve** ser enviada para o novo local retornado (URL), mas o cliente deve continuar usando o URI original para solicitações futuras. |

---

#### 4. Códigos 4XX - Erro do Cliente

| Status Code | Reason Phrase | Descrição |
|:-----------:|:-------------|:----------|
| **400** | Bad Request | O servidor não pode processar a solicitação devido a um **erro do cliente**, por exemplo, solicitação inválida ou dados transmitidos muito grandes. |
| **401** | Unauthorized | O cliente que faz a solicitação **não está autorizado** e deve se **autenticar**. |
| **403** | Forbidden | A solicitação era válida, mas o servidor está **recusando-se a processá-la**. Geralmente ocorre por permissões insuficientes. |
| **404** | Not Found | O servidor **não encontrou o recurso solicitado**. |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed | O servidor web **não suporta o método HTTP** usado na solicitação (ex: tentar usar `PUT` em um recurso que só aceita `GET` e `POST`). |

---

#### 5. Códigos 5XX - Erro do Servidor

| Status Code | Reason Phrase | Descrição |
|:-----------:|:-------------|:----------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Um código de erro genérico retornado quando um erro inesperado ou uma condição ocorreu durante o processamento da solicitação **no servidor**. |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | O servidor web, enquanto atuava como gateway ou proxy, recebeu uma **resposta inválida** do servidor *upstream* (o servidor da aplicação). |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | O servidor web **não pode processar a solicitação** no momento (geralmente devido a sobrecarga ou manutenção). |

### HTTP Response Headers
Following the status line, there are optional HTTP response headers followed by a line break.

Similar to the request headers, there are many possible HTTP headers that can be included in the HTTP response.

Common response headers are:

```http
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:00:00 GMT+2
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Linux)
Content-Length: 84
Content-Type: text/html
```

* The ```Date``` header specifies the date and time the HTTP response was generated.

* The ```Server``` header describes the web server software used to generate the response.

* The ```Content-Length``` header describes the length of the response.

* The ```Content-Type``` header describes the media type of the resource returned (e.g. HTML document, image, video).

### HTTP Response Body
Following the HTTP response headers is the HTTP response body. This is the main content of the HTTP response.

This can contain images, video, HTML documents and other media types.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:00:00 GMT+2
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Linux)
Content-Length: 84
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <head><title>Test</title></head>
  <body>Test HTML page.</body>
</html>
```



## Other Internet Protocols

Hypertext Transfer Protocols (HTTP) are used on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to transfer webpages and other content from websites.
This reading explores other protocols commonly used on the Internet.

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
You've learned that computers need IP addresses to communicate with each other. When your computer connects to a network, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP as it is commonly known, is used to assign your computer an IP address.
Your computer communicates over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using the protocol with a type of server called a DHCP server. The server keeps track of computers on the network and their IP addresses. It will assign your computer an IP address and respond over the protocol to let it know which IP address to use. Once your computer has an IP address, it can communicate with other computers on the network.

### Domain Name System Protocol (DNS)
Your computer needs a way to know with which IP address to communicate when you visit a website in your web browser, for example, meta.com. The Domain Name System Protocol, commonly known as DNS, provides this function. Your computer then checks with the DNS server associated with the domain name and then returns the correct IP address.

### Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
Do you check your emails on your mobile or tablet device? Or maybe you use an email application on your computer?
Your device needs a way to download emails and manage your mailbox on the server storing your emails. This is the purpose of the Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP.

### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Now that your emails are on your device, you need a way to send emails. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, is used. It allows email clients to submit emails for sending via an SMTP server. You can also use it to receive emails from an email client, but IMAP is more commonly used.

### Post Office Protocol (POP)
The Post Office Protocol (POP) is an older protocol used to download emails to an email client. The main difference in using POP instead of IMAP is that POP will delete the emails on the server once they have been downloaded to your local device. Although it is no longer commonly used in email clients, developers often use it to implement email automation as it is a more straightforward protocol than IMAP.

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
When running your websites and web applications on the Internet, you'll need a way to transfer the files from your local computer to the server they'll run on. The standard protocol used for this is the File Transfer Protocol or FTP. FTP allows you to list, send, receive and delete files on a server. Your server must run an FTP Server and you will need an FTP Client on your local machine. You'll learn more about these in a later course.

### Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)
When you start working with servers, you'll also need a way to log in and interact with the computer remotely. The most common method of doing this is using the Secure Shell Protocol, commonly referred to as SSH. Using an SSH client allows you to connect to an SSH server running on a server to perform commands on the remote computer.
All data sent over SSH is encrypted. This means that third parties cannot understand the data transmitted. Only the sending and receiving computers can understand the data.

### Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
The data is transmitted insecurely when using the File Transfer Protocol. This means that third parties may understand the data that you are sending. This is not right if you transmit company files such as software and databases. To solve this, the SSH File Transfer Protocol, alternatively called the Secure File Transfer Protocol, can be used to transfer files over the SSH protocol. This ensures that the data is transmitted securely. Most FTP clients also support the SFTP protocol.
